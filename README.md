open-startup-docs
=================

Open source legal documents for common startup transactions, other than
financing

Purpose
-------

This repository is for collaboratively creating less-sexy open source legal
documents for startups.

There are already several sets of open source financing documents available,
such as [Series Seed][1], Y Combinator’s [SAFE][2], etc. Although there is still
[work to be done][3] in that area, financing is not the focus of this
repository. Our focus here is on everything else: **the legal nuts and bolts
that keep a startup running between financing rounds**.

Documents
---------

We hope to work on the following common documents:

-   Advisor agreement

-   Non-disclosure agreements

-   Employee and independent contractor agreements (although these may vary too
    much by state)
